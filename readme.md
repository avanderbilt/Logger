# Logger

The Logger is a simple program for logging activity throughout the day in a text file with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) formatting.

The main and only window has several controls.

The large text area is where the information to be logged is entered. Entering something here and clicking the "Log" button or pressing Ctrl+L will cause an entry to be written to the log file that will be date / time stamped.

To open the log file, click the "Open" button or press Ctrl+L.

To open the folder containing the log file, click the "Folder" button or press Ctrl+Shift+F.

The program will always minimize to the notification tray.

The "Start / Stop" button will cause a timer to begin counting down the number of minutes shown in the small text box next to the "Start / Stop" button. The application will minimize and get out of the way when the timer is started. When the timer completes, the program will pop a little bubble up in the system tray.

Pressing Ctrl+Shift+D will give you the option of deleting the log file.

Pressing Ctrl+Shift+A will give you the option of archiving the log file. This will rename the log file with a date / time stamp as the new extension.

The application's icon was downloaded from [IconArchive](http://www.iconarchive.com/show/sleek-xp-software-icons-by-deleket/Notepad-icon.html) and was created by [Deleket](http://www.deleket.com).
