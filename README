The Logger is a simple program that I created for logging activity throughout the day in a simple text file.

The main and only window has several controls.

The large text area is where the information to be logged is entered. Entering something here and clicking the "Log" button will cause an entry to be written to the log file that will be date / time stamped.

To open the log file, click the "Open" button.

To open the folder containing the log file, click the "Folder" button.

The program will always minimize to the notification tray.

The "Start / Stop" button will cause a timer to begin counting down the number or minutes shown in the small text box next to the "Start / Stop" button. The application will minimize and get out of the way when the timer is started. When the timer completes, the program's window will be normalized and brought to the front.

Pressing Ctrl+Shift+D will give you the option of deleting the log file.

Pressing Ctrl+Shift+A will give you the option of archiving the log file. This will rename the log file with a date / time stamp as the new extension.
